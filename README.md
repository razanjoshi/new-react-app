# README

This is basically a web scraper rails app with a hint of react on the frontend.

What is does is:
 - It goes to the urls of all the selenium hubs we have.
 - Scrapes the active nodes.
 - Gives back the count of the active nodes.

I have used Kimurai framework for web scraping in this project.
